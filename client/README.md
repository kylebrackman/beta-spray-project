# Beta Spray
Beta Spray is an application solely based around unlocking the moves to your hardest climbing projects! "Beta" is climbing lingo that refers to specific movement and hold styles that can help other climbers complete technical faces. Currently, Beta Spray is anonymous, and you can only delete and edit comments that you post yourself!

## Why Beta Spray?
It can be difficult to push your limits on climbing grades if you are in a new area, the movement is foreign to you, or if you are unfamiliar with what type of gear you'll need. With the help of Beta Spray and the climbing community, you can get some help with your toughest projects!

## How Beta Spray is Written
Beta spray is written using a React front end and a Ruby on Rails back end.

## Future Additions
Future updates will include possible user names with each piece of beta. I would also love to include a way for users to be able to take photos of specific climbs and upload them directly to Beta Spray. This would be huge in terms of context for each climb. 

More updates will also include password reset options, and user profiles.
